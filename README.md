## Simple Storage

This Simple Storage contract goes through the bare basics of Solidity,
by building a mini-application. You can change and retrieve the value
of [favoriteNumber] by calling the functions [setFavoriteNumber] and [getFavoriteNumber].
Call [setPerson] and create an imaginary [Person], who will be
pushed into [getPersonAndNumber], where you can retrieve 
[favoriteNumber] and [name], the properties of [Person] and added to [getPersonNumber],
where you can retrieve [favoriteNumber] of [Person] by entering [name].
